## Methodology
This security assessment was performed using GrepIntel, a tool that combines pattern-based identification with LLM-powered analysis to detect potential security vulnerabilities in source code. The process involves:

1. Pattern matching to identify potentially vulnerable code sections
2. Context extraction around matched patterns
3. LLM-based analysis to determine if the identified code represents a genuine security vulnerability
4. Severity assessment based on potential impact and exploitability
5. Generation of recommendations for remediation

## Disclaimer
This report is generated automatically and should be reviewed by a security professional. While the tool uses advanced techniques to identify vulnerabilities, it may not detect all security issues, and some findings may be false positives.
