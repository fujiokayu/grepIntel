# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Security engineers and developers need efficient tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities in source code. Manual code reviews are time-consuming and prone to oversight, while many automated tools produce high rates of false positives or miss context-dependent vulnerabilities.

## Solution
GrepIntel bridges this gap by combining pattern-based identification with advanced LLM analysis. The tool:
1. Uses curated grep patterns to identify potentially vulnerable code sections
2. Extracts relevant source code for deeper analysis
3. Leverages LLMs to understand context and identify genuine security concerns
4. Compiles findings into comprehensive security reports

## User Experience Goals
- Simple CLI interface for security engineers
- Clear, actionable security reports
- Minimal false positives compared to traditional static analysis
- Customizable security aspects and language support
- Flexible integration with different LLM providers

## Target Users
- Security engineers performing white-box testing
- Development teams implementing security reviews
- Organizations maintaining secure coding practices
