# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing core components of the GrepIntel tool
- Developing the security pattern management system
- Setting up the command-line interface

- Implemented security analyzer for LLM-based vulnerability analysis
- Added severity assessment for identified vulnerabilities
- Implemented report generation system with templating
- Updated .clinerules with testing best practices
- Changed approach to multilingual support: LLM now responds directly in the specified language
- Modified SecurityAnalyzer to add language instructions to prompts
- Restored language-specific report templates for better localization
- Changed default batch size from 3 to 5 for optimal performance
- Enabled LLM chat logging by default for better analysis and debugging
- Added Ruby language security patterns with optimized regex patterns
- Added Ruby on Rails framework security patterns with optimized regex patterns
- Updated config.py to add Ruby file extensions (.rb, .erb, .rake, .gemspec, .ru) to FILE_EXTENSIONS dictionary

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Set up Python 3.11+ with venv virtual environment
2. ✅ Create basic project structure with linting configuration
3. ✅ Set up pytest framework with coverage reporting
4. ✅ Implement pattern management for security grep patterns (TDD approach)
5. ✅ Develop file scanning functionality
6. ✅ Implement source code extraction
7. ✅ Build LLM client interfaces
8. ✅ Implement security analysis pipeline
9. ✅ Create report generation system
10. ✅ Add support for additional languages (Ruby) and frameworks (Rails)
11. Implement end-to-end testing
12. Add comprehensive documentation

## Active Decisions
- Using Python for implementation due to its rich ecosystem and simplicity
- Supporting multiple LLM providers for flexibility and redundancy
- Structuring the project with clear separation of concerns
- Using environment variables for secure API key management
- Following TDD principles with minimum 80% test coverage
- Using venv for virtual environment management
- Organizing security patterns by language and framework in separate text files
- Supporting both English and Japanese for reports and analysis
- Separating LLM prompts and report templates into different directories
- Using a hierarchical approach for pattern management (language + framework)
- Implementing a strategy pattern for LLM clients to support multiple providers
- Using a factory pattern for LLM client creation based on environment variables
- Implementing batch processing to analyze multiple vulnerabilities at once, reducing API calls. Using fixed-size batching with plans to explore vulnerability type-based grouping in the future. This improves execution time and optimizes token usage.
- Optimizing regex patterns by combining similar patterns to improve performance while maintaining detection capabilities

## Verification Practices
- When running verification tests, use the following command-line options:
  - `--output vulnerability_report.md`: Standardize output filename (also in .gitignore)
  - `--report-language ja`: Test with Japanese to verify translation functionality
  - `--batch-size 5`: Recommended batch size for optimal performance
  - `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging for better debugging
  - `--language php`: Specify the target language explicitly
  - `--log-chat`: Enable LLM chat logging for analysis
- Always check the generated report for proper formatting and translation
- Verify error handling by testing with various edge cases
- For translation testing, check both successful translation and fallback behavior
