# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initial project setup and architecture design
- Creating the memory bank structure
- Defining the core components and workflows

## Recent Changes
- Project initialization
- Memory bank creation

## Next Steps
1. Set up Python 3.11+ with venv virtual environment
2. Create basic project structure with linting configuration
3. Set up pytest framework with coverage reporting
4. Implement pattern management for security grep patterns (TDD approach)
5. Develop file scanning functionality
6. Build LLM client interfaces
7. Implement security analysis pipeline
8. Create report generation system

## Active Decisions
- Using Python for implementation due to its rich ecosystem and simplicity
- Supporting multiple LLM providers for flexibility and redundancy
- Structuring the project with clear separation of concerns
- Using environment variables for secure API key management
- Following TDD principles with minimum 80% test coverage
- Using venv for virtual environment management
