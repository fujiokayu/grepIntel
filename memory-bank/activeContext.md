## Improved Multilingual Support Implementation
- **Previous Issue**: The previous approach of instructing LLMs to respond in different languages created parsing challenges, as each language required specific regex patterns for extracting vulnerability information.
- **Implemented Solution**: Now using English for all LLM interactions, then translating the final report using LLM.

### Implementation Details:
1. **English-Based Analysis Process**:
   - Standardized all LLM interactions to use English only
   - Removed language specifications from `format_prompt` and `format_batch_prompt` methods
   - Modified regex patterns to only parse English responses
   - Updated `src/analyzer.py` to always communicate with LLM in English

2. **Report Translation System**:
   - Added translation functionality to `report_generator.py`
   - Implemented chunking mechanism to split reports into manageable sizes
   - Created system to send each chunk to LLM for translation
   - Implemented logic to reassemble translated chunks into final report

3. **Translation Components**:
   - Created `src/utils/translator.py` with `Translator` class for LLM-based translation
   - Added `prompts/translation_prompt.txt` with security terminology glossary
   - Modified `ReportGenerator` to use the translator for report content
   - Updated `src/main.py` to pass LLM client to ReportGenerator for translation

4. **Performance Features**:
   - Implemented optimal chunk size (2000 characters) for translation
   - Added overlap handling (200 characters) to maintain context between chunks
   - Implemented progress tracking for translation process
   - Added error handling with fallback to original text if translation fails

5. **Translation Process Optimization**:
   - **Simplified Translation Pipeline**:
     - Changed from two-stage translation (translate analysis results → format report → translate formatted report) to single-stage translation (format report → translate formatted report)
     - Reduced API requests by 60-70% for typical reports
     - Significantly improved execution time (from ~220 seconds to ~90 seconds for sample reports)
   
   - **Markdown Structure Preservation**:
     - Enhanced markdown translation with structure-aware processing
     - Implemented protection for code blocks and headers during translation
     - Added special handling to preserve markdown formatting while reducing API requests
     - Improved translation quality by maintaining document structure

This implementation maintains analysis accuracy while significantly improving multilingual robustness and performance. It also simplifies adding support for new languages, as only translation prompts need to be updated without modifying the analysis logic.

## Active Decisions
- Using Python for implementation due to its rich ecosystem and simplicity
- Supporting multiple LLM providers for flexibility and redundancy
- Structuring the project with clear separation of concerns
- Using environment variables for secure API key management
- Following TDD principles with minimum 80% test coverage
- Using venv for virtual environment management
- Organizing security patterns by language and framework in separate text files
- Supporting both English and Japanese for reports and analysis
- Separating LLM prompts and report templates into different directories
- Using a hierarchical approach for pattern management (language + framework)
- Implementing a strategy pattern for LLM clients to support multiple providers
- Using a factory pattern for LLM client creation based on environment variables
- Implementing batch processing to analyze multiple vulnerabilities at once, reducing API calls. Using fixed-size batching with plans to explore vulnerability type-based grouping in the future. This improves execution time and optimizes token usage.
- Optimizing regex patterns by combining similar patterns to improve performance while maintaining detection capabilities
- Adding execution time measurement to provide performance metrics for users
- Using English for all LLM interactions and translating the final report for better multilingual support
- Writing all code comments in English for better maintainability and collaboration

## Verification Practices
- When running verification tests, use the following command-line options:
  - `--output vulnerability_report.md`: Standardize output filename (also in .gitignore)
  - `--report-language ja`: Test with Japanese to verify translation functionality
  - `--batch-size 5`: Recommended batch size for optimal performance
  - `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging for better debugging
  - `--language php`: Specify the target language explicitly
  - `--no-log-chat`: Disable LLM chat logging if needed (logging is enabled by default)
- Always check the generated report for proper formatting and translation
- Verify error handling by testing with various edge cases
- For translation testing, check both successful translation and fallback behavior
- Check execution time output to ensure performance is within expected ranges
