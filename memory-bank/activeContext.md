13. ðŸ”„ Improve multilingual support with post-analysis translation approach

## Improved Multilingual Support Plan
- **Current Issue**: The current approach of instructing LLMs to respond in different languages creates parsing challenges, as each language requires specific regex patterns for extracting vulnerability information.
- **Proposed Solution**: Use English for all LLM interactions, then translate the final report using LLM.

### Implementation Plan:
1. **English-Based Analysis Process**:
   - Standardize all LLM interactions to use English only
   - Remove language specifications from `format_prompt` and `format_batch_prompt` methods
   - Ensure vulnerability analysis responses are always received in English

2. **Report Translation System Implementation**:
   - Add translation functionality to `report_generator.py`
   - Implement chunking mechanism to split reports into manageable sizes
   - Send each chunk to LLM for translation
   - Reassemble translated chunks into final report

3. **Translation Prompt Optimization**:
   - Create dedicated prompts for accurate translation of security terminology
   - Include language-specific translation instructions
   - Provide glossary of terms to maintain consistency

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Modify `src/analyzer.py`: Change to always communicate with LLM in English
   - Extend `src/report_generator.py`: Add translation capabilities
   - Create translation utility class in `src/utils/`
   - Add translation prompt templates to `prompts/` directory
   - Test: Verify translation quality in each supported language

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize translation chunk size
   - Implement parallel processing for faster translation
   - Consider caching mechanism to avoid re-translating identical text

This approach will maintain analysis accuracy while significantly improving multilingual robustness. It will also simplify adding support for new languages, as only translation prompts would need to be added without modifying the analysis logic.

## Active Decisions
- Using Python for implementation due to its rich ecosystem and simplicity
- Supporting multiple LLM providers for flexibility and redundancy
- Structuring the project with clear separation of concerns
- Using environment variables for secure API key management
- Following TDD principles with minimum 80% test coverage
- Using venv for virtual environment management
- Organizing security patterns by language and framework in separate text files
- Supporting both English and Japanese for reports and analysis
- Separating LLM prompts and report templates into different directories
- Using a hierarchical approach for pattern management (language + framework)
- Implementing a strategy pattern for LLM clients to support multiple providers
- Using a factory pattern for LLM client creation based on environment variables
- Implementing batch processing to analyze multiple vulnerabilities at once, reducing API calls. Using fixed-size batching with plans to explore vulnerability type-based grouping in the future. This improves execution time and optimizes token usage.
- Optimizing regex patterns by combining similar patterns to improve performance while maintaining detection capabilities
- Adding execution time measurement to provide performance metrics for users

## Verification Practices
- When running verification tests, use the following command-line options:
  - `--output vulnerability_report.md`: Standardize output filename (also in .gitignore)
  - `--report-language ja`: Test with Japanese to verify translation functionality
  - `--batch-size 5`: Recommended batch size for optimal performance
  - `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging for better debugging
  - `--language php`: Specify the target language explicitly
  - `--no-log-chat`: Disable LLM chat logging if needed (logging is enabled by default)
- Always check the generated report for proper formatting and translation
- Verify error handling by testing with various edge cases
- For translation testing, check both successful translation and fallback behavior
- Check execution time output to ensure performance is within expected ranges
