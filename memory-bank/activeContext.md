# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing core components of the GrepIntel tool
- Developing the security pattern management system
- Setting up the command-line interface
- Organizing project structure for better maintainability
- Enhancing pattern management with framework-specific patterns

## Recent Changes
- Project initialization
- Memory bank creation
- Basic project structure setup
- Pattern management implementation (TDD approach)
- Command-line interface implementation
- Security pattern definitions for PHP and Java
- Moved report templates from prompts/ to templates/ directory
- Enhanced pattern management to support framework-specific patterns
- Reorganized intelligence directory to separate language and framework patterns
- Added framework-specific pattern files for Laravel and Rails

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Set up Python 3.11+ with venv virtual environment
2. ✅ Create basic project structure with linting configuration
3. ✅ Set up pytest framework with coverage reporting
4. ✅ Implement pattern management for security grep patterns (TDD approach)
5. Develop file scanning functionality
6. Build LLM client interfaces
7. Implement security analysis pipeline
8. Create report generation system

## Active Decisions
- Using Python for implementation due to its rich ecosystem and simplicity
- Supporting multiple LLM providers for flexibility and redundancy
- Structuring the project with clear separation of concerns
- Using environment variables for secure API key management
- Following TDD principles with minimum 80% test coverage
- Using venv for virtual environment management
- Organizing security patterns by language and framework in separate text files
- Supporting both English and Japanese for reports and analysis
- Separating LLM prompts and report templates into different directories
- Using a hierarchical approach for pattern management (language + framework)
