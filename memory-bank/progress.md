## Implementation Details

### Completed Components

#### Security Analysis Pipeline
- Implemented `SecurityAnalyzer` class for LLM-based vulnerability analysis
- Added support for analyzing potential vulnerabilities using LLM
- Implemented severity assessment based on vulnerability type and impact
- Added error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Integrated with the main application flow
- Added comprehensive unit tests with mocking for LLM interactions

#### Report Generation System
- Implemented `ReportGenerator` class for generating security assessment reports
- Added support for multiple report languages (English and Japanese)
- Implemented template-based report generation
- Added statistics calculation and executive summary generation
- Implemented vulnerability findings formatting
- Added comprehensive unit tests
- Integrated with the main application flow

#### LLM Client Interfaces
- Implemented abstract `LLMClient` interface for standardized LLM interactions
- Created client implementations for multiple LLM providers:
  - OpenAI client for GPT models
  - Claude client for Anthropic models
  - DeepSeek client for DeepSeek models
- Added factory pattern for client creation based on environment variables
- Implemented token counting and text truncation utilities
- Added retry logic and error handling for API rate limits
- Integrated with main application flow
- Added comprehensive unit tests with mocking for API interactions
- Updated main.py to initialize and use LLM clients

#### Source Code Extraction
- Implemented `CodeExtractor` class for extracting relevant code snippets
- Added context-aware code extraction for identified vulnerabilities
- Implemented configurable context window size
- Added support for formatting extracted code for LLM input
- Implemented token limit handling for LLM input
- Added comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- Integrated code extraction with command-line interface

#### File Scanning
- Implemented `FileScanner` class for scanning files and directories
- Added support for recursive directory traversal
- Implemented pattern matching using regular expressions
- Added file extension to language mapping
- Implemented detailed vulnerability reporting
- Added comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- Integrated file scanning with command-line interface

#### Pattern Management
- Implemented `PatternManager` class for loading and managing security patterns
- Created language-specific pattern files for PHP and Java
- Added support for loading patterns from files and directories
- Implemented pattern retrieval by language
- Added comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- Enhanced pattern management to support framework-specific patterns
- Implemented hierarchical pattern management (language + framework)
- Created framework-specific pattern files for Laravel and Rails
- Reorganized intelligence directory structure to separate language and framework patterns

#### Command-line Interface
- Implemented argument parsing with support for:
  - Target directory/file selection
  - Language filtering
  - Framework selection
  - Output file specification
  - Report language selection
  - Verbose logging
- Added environment variable validation
- Implemented basic logging system

#### Project Structure
- Organized code into modular components
- Set up testing framework with pytest
- Configured linting and formatting tools
- Created CI/CD workflow for automated testing
- Separated LLM prompts and report templates into different directories:
  - `prompts/`: Contains LLM prompt templates
  - `templates/`: Contains report templates
