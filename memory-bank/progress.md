## Implementation Details

### Completed Components

#### Pattern Management
- Implemented `PatternManager` class for loading and managing security patterns
- Created language-specific pattern files for PHP and Java
- Added support for loading patterns from files and directories
- Implemented pattern retrieval by language
- Added comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- Enhanced pattern management to support framework-specific patterns
- Implemented hierarchical pattern management (language + framework)
- Created framework-specific pattern files for Laravel and Rails
- Reorganized intelligence directory structure to separate language and framework patterns

#### Command-line Interface
- Implemented argument parsing with support for:
  - Target directory/file selection
  - Language filtering
  - Framework selection
  - Output file specification
  - Report language selection
  - Verbose logging
- Added environment variable validation
- Implemented basic logging system

#### Project Structure
- Organized code into modular components
- Set up testing framework with pytest
- Configured linting and formatting tools
- Created CI/CD workflow for automated testing
- Separated LLM prompts and report templates into different directories:
  - `prompts/`: Contains LLM prompt templates
  - `templates/`: Contains report templates
