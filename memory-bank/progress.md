## Implementation Details

### Completed Components

#### Security Analysis Pipeline
- Implemented `SecurityAnalyzer` class for LLM-based vulnerability analysis
- Added support for analyzing potential vulnerabilities using LLM
- Implemented severity assessment based on vulnerability type and impact
- Added error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Integrated with the main application flow
- Added comprehensive unit tests with mocking for LLM interactions

#### Report Generation System
- Implemented `ReportGenerator` class for generating security assessment reports
- Added support for multiple report languages (English and Japanese)
- Implemented template-based report generation
- Added statistics calculation and executive summary generation
- Implemented vulnerability findings formatting
- Added comprehensive unit tests
- Integrated with the main application flow
- Added conditional section processing: Implemented control for displaying/hiding content based on statistics
- Improved template structure: Integrated executive summary directly into templates to resolve language-dependent issues
- Optimized report layout: Enhanced readability by repositioning the statistics section

#### LLM Client Interfaces
- Implemented abstract `LLMClient` interface for standardized LLM interactions
- Created client implementations for multiple LLM providers:
  - OpenAI client for GPT models
  - Claude client for Anthropic models
  - DeepSeek client for DeepSeek models
- Added factory pattern for client creation based on environment variables
- Implemented token counting and text truncation utilities
- Added retry logic and error handling for API rate limits
- Integrated with main application flow
- Added comprehensive unit tests with mocking for API interactions
- Updated main.py to initialize and use LLM clients

#### Source Code Extraction
- Implemented `CodeExtractor` class for extracting relevant code snippets
- Added context-aware code extraction for identified vulnerabilities
- Implemented configurable context window size
- Added support for formatting extracted code for LLM input
- Implemented token limit handling for LLM input
- Added comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- Integrated code extraction with command-line interface

#### File Scanning
- Implemented `FileScanner` class for scanning files and directories
- Added support for recursive directory traversal
- Implemented pattern matching using regular expressions
- Added file extension to language mapping
- Implemented detailed vulnerability reporting
- Added comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- Integrated file scanning with command-line interface

#### Pattern Management
- Implemented `PatternManager` class for loading and managing security patterns
- Created language-specific pattern files for PHP and Java
- Added support for loading patterns from files and directories
- Implemented pattern retrieval by language
- Added comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- Enhanced pattern management to support framework-specific patterns
- Implemented hierarchical pattern management (language + framework)
- Created framework-specific pattern files for Laravel and Rails
- Reorganized intelligence directory structure to separate language and framework patterns
- Added Ruby language security patterns with optimized regex patterns covering SQL injection, command injection, XSS, path traversal, insecure deserialization, remote code execution, SSRF, XXE, insecure random number generation, and insecure cryptography
- Added Ruby on Rails framework security patterns with optimized regex patterns covering mass assignment, ActiveRecord injection, XSS, CSRF, remote code execution, insecure file upload, unsafe redirects, insecure deserialization, authorization flaws, session management, sensitive data exposure, and insecure headers
- Added Go language security patterns with optimized regex patterns covering SQL injection, command injection, XSS, path traversal, insecure deserialization, remote code execution, SSRF, XXE, insecure random number generation, insecure cryptography, authorization flaws, and sensitive data exposure
- Added Node.js language security patterns with optimized regex patterns covering SQL injection, command injection, XSS, path traversal, insecure deserialization, remote code execution, SSRF, XXE, insecure random number generation, insecure cryptography, authorization flaws, sensitive data exposure, NoSQL injection, prototype pollution, regex DoS, and open redirect vulnerabilities
- Updated Ruby language security patterns with English comments
- Optimized regex patterns by combining similar patterns to improve performance while maintaining detection capabilities
- Updated `config.py` to add Ruby file extensions (.rb, .erb, .rake, .gemspec, .ru) to FILE_EXTENSIONS dictionary to enable Ruby language detection in the command-line interface

#### Command-line Interface
- Implemented argument parsing with support for:
  - Target directory/file selection
  - Language filtering (with support for multiple languages)
  - Framework selection
  - Output file specification
  - Report language selection
  - Verbose logging
- Added environment variable validation
- Implemented basic logging system
- Improved usability with better defaults:
  - LLM chat logging enabled by default with `--no-log-chat` option to disable
  - Multiple language specification support instead of 'all' option
- Added execution time measurement and display to provide performance metrics for users

#### Project Structure
- Organized code into modular components
- Set up testing framework with pytest
- Configured linting and formatting tools
- Created CI/CD workflow for automated testing
- Separated LLM prompts and report templates into different directories:
  - `prompts/`: Contains LLM prompt templates
  - `templates/`: Contains report templates
