# GrepIntel: White-Box Security Assessment CLI Tool

## Project Overview
GrepIntel is a command-line tool designed for white-box security vulnerability assessment. It automates the process of identifying potential security issues in source code by leveraging language-specific pattern matching and LLM-powered analysis.

## Core Requirements
1. Create and maintain language-specific security grep patterns
2. Scan target directories to identify files with potential security concerns
3. Extract and analyze source code from identified files
4. Leverage multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek) for security analysis
5. Generate comprehensive security assessment reports

## Project Goals
- Streamline the security assessment process for developers and security engineers
- Provide actionable insights into potential security vulnerabilities
- Support multiple programming languages and security aspects
- Offer flexibility in LLM provider selection
- Generate detailed, well-structured security reports
